If appropriate, create a new skill using the skill-creator Skill.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\n### When TO CREATE a skill:\n- Workflow has multiple steps (3+) with a clear structure\n- Process involves multiple tool integrations\n- Pattern is repeatable across different inputs/contexts\n- Approach can be templated for similar problems\n\n### When NOT TO create a skill:\n- Workflow is too simple (1-2 steps only)\n- No clear repeatable pattern exists\n- Task is too particular to this single use case\n- Process is too variable or context-dependent to formalize\n- A similar skill already exists without significant improvements\n\n## Analysis Strategy for Multiple Conversations\n\nWhen analyzing multiple conversations:\n\n1. **Identify Common Patterns**\n   - What workflow steps appear across multiple conversations?\n   - What tool combinations are consistently used?\n   - What problem-solving approaches are repeated?\n\n2. **Note Variations**\n   - How do users phrase similar requests differently?\n   - What parameters or inputs vary between conversations?\n   - Which parts of the workflow are consistent vs. variable?\n\n3. **Assess Generalizability**\n   - Can the pattern be abstracted to handle all observed cases?\n   - Would the skill work for variations not yet seen?\n   - Is the pattern domain-specific or more general?\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Analyze all conversations**\n   - Identify core workflow patterns in EACH conversation\n   - Look for commonalities across conversations\n   - Assess overall reusability and generalizability\n   - If not worth creating → **Skip to step 4**\n\n2. **Review available skills to avoid duplication**\n   - Check if similar skill already exists\n   - If similar skill exists:\n     * Create new version only if significant improvements can be made\n     * If no significant improvement → **Skip to step 4**\n \n3. **Create the skill (if appropriate)**\n   - Follow skill-creator Skill guidelines strictly\n   - Make it generic enough for reuse, specific enough for utility\n\n4. **Explain your decision**\n   - If creating: Describe the workflow pattern identified and why it's valuable as a reusable skill\n   - If skipping: Explain clearly why no skill was created\n\n## Conversation Histories to Analyze\n\nconversation 1:\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"2025년 동안 예정된 주요 AI/ML 컨퍼런스를 검색하고, 개최 날짜, 개최 장소, 주요 세션(트랙·키노트 포함), 공식 등록 링크를 시간순으로 정리해서 현재 작업 디렉토리에 있는 results/20251114_151329에 game_releases_2025h1.md로 저장해줘.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"citations\": null,\n        \"text\": \"2025년 주요 AI/ML 컨퍼런스 정보를 검색하고 정리해드리겠습니다.\",\n        \"type\": \"text\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"toolu_01Kt5P1DkNsxdfmSWqu4FJ2S\",\n        \"input\": {\n          \"query\": \"major AI ML conferences 2025 schedule dates venues\",\n          \"max_results\": 10\n        },\n        \"name\": \"mcp-server-search__web_search\",\n        \"type\": \"tool_use\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"toolu_01M53oQfaLA1nEAtwZda75YN\",\n        \"input\": {\n          \"query\": \"NeurIPS ICML CVPR ICLR 2025 conference dates location\",\n          \"max_results\": 10\n        },\n        \"name\": \"mcp-server-search__web_search\",\n        \"type\": \"tool_use\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n        \"tool_use_id\": \"toolu_01Kt5P1DkNsxdfmSWqu4FJ2S\",\n        \"content\": \"Search: major AI ML conferences 2025 schedule dates venues\\n\\n\\nduckduckgo (10 results):\\n\\n1.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\n**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited*)\n\n*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAlso, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n\nTo complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n2. When should the skill be used?\n3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.zip`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n",

Use this skill to systematically research, aggregate, organize chronologically, and document release information with consistent formatting.\n---\n\n# Release Tracker\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill enables systematic research and documentation of upcoming releases and scheduled events across various domains. It provides a structured workflow for gathering information from multiple sources, organizing it chronologically, and presenting it in a well-formatted document suitable for future reference.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nUse this skill when users request information about:\n- **Conference schedules** (e.g., \"2025 AI/ML conferences\")\n- **Product launches** (e.g., \"Q1 2025 smartphone releases\")\n- **Event calendars** (e.g., \"upcoming tech conferences in Europe\")\n- **Entertainment releases** (e.g., \"2025 video game releases\", \"upcoming movies\")\n- **Software releases** (e.g., \"major framework updates in 2025\")\n\n**Trigger patterns:**\n- \"Upcoming [category] in [timeframe]\"\n- \"Schedule of [events/releases] for [period]\"\n- \"List of [products/events] launching in [quarter/year]\"\n- Requests specifying date ranges, quarters, or years for release information\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Understand Requirements\n\nClarify with the user:\n- **Topic/Domain**: What type of releases or events (conferences, phones, games, etc.)?\n- **Time Period**: Specific quarter, year, or date range?\n- **Output Format**: File format preference (markdown, text, CSV)?\n- **Output Location**: Where to save the file?\n- **Detail Level**: What information to include (dates, specs, prices, locations)?\n\n### Step 2: Initial Broad Search\n\nConduct 2-3 broad web searches to identify the landscape:\n\n**Search strategy:**\n- Combine topic + timeframe + general keywords\n- Use both English and local language if applicable\n- Target authoritative sources (official sites, tech news, industry publications)\n\n**Example queries:**\n- `\"Q1 2025\" smartphone launches January February March`\n- `2025 AI ML conferences schedule dates venues`\n- `upcoming video game releases 2025 first half`\n\n**Goals:**\n- Identify major items/events in the category\n- Discover official announcement patterns\n- Find authoritative sources\n\n### Step 3: Targeted Detail Searches\n\nFor each major item identified, conduct focused searches:\n\n**Search strategy:**\n- Search for specific names + key details (dates, specs, locations)\n- Target official websites when possible\n- Look for confirmation from multiple sources\n\n**Example queries:**\n- `\"Samsung Galaxy S25\" \"January 2025\" launch date specifications`\n- `\"ICLR 2025\" dates location Singapore registration`\n- `\"Elden Ring DLC\" release date June 2025`\n\n**Use fetch operations:**\n- When official URLs are discovered, fetch them directly for authoritative information\n- Official sites typically have: release dates, specifications, registration links, schedules\n\n### Step 4: Organize Information Chronologically\n\nStructure the gathered information with consistent formatting:\n\n**Organizational principles:**\n- **Primary sort**: Chronological by release/event date\n- **Secondary grouping**: By month, quarter, or logical category\n- **Include for each entry:**\n  - Name/title (clear, official naming)\n  - Date (specific dates when available, otherwise month/quarter)\n  - Location (for physical events) or platform (for digital releases)\n  - Key details (specifications, sessions, features - domain-specific)\n  - Official links (registration, purchase, information)\n\n**Formatting guidelines:**\n- Use clear headings and sections\n- Include visual separators for readability\n- Add summary tables when appropriate\n- Include metadata (creation date, sources, caveats)\n\n### Step 5: Create Output Document\n\nGenerate the document in the requested format and location:\n\n**Format-specific considerations:**\n\n**Markdown (.md):**\n- Use heading hierarchy (##, ###)\n- Include tables for quick reference\n- Add emoji or visual markers for categories\n- Use bold/italic for emphasis\n\n**Text (.txt):**\n- Use ASCII separators (===, ---)\n- Maintain consistent indentation\n- Use CAPITALIZATION or *markers* for emphasis\n\n**CSV (.csv):**\n- Column headers: Name, Date, Location, Category, Details, URL\n- One row per item\n- Escape commas in data fields\n\n**File creation steps:**\n1. Verify the target directory exists (create if needed)\n2. Write content in logical chunks (not all at once if large)\n3. Verify file was created successfully\n4. Provide user with summary of what was documented\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n### Information Accuracy\n- Prioritize official sources over rumors or speculation\n- Mark speculative information clearly (e.g., \"expected\", \"rumored\")\n- Include dates when information was gathered\n- Note when official confirmation is pending\n\n### Completeness\n- Cover all major items in the requested timeframe\n- Don't skip items due to incomplete information - include what's available\n- Add \"TBA\" or \"To be announced\" for missing details\n- Include trends or patterns observed across items\n\n### Formatting Consistency\n- Use the same structure for each entry\n- Maintain consistent date formats (e.g., \"January 15, 2025\" or \"2025-01-15\")\n- Apply uniform heading levels and spacing\n- Include helpful navigation (table of contents for long documents)\n\n## Example Outputs\n\n### Conference Schedule (Markdown)\n```markdown\n# 2025 AI/ML Conferences\n\n## Q1 2025\n\n### AAAI 2025\n**Date:** February 25 - March 4, 2025\n**Location:** Philadelphia, PA, USA\n**Focus:** General Artificial Intelligence\n**Registration:** https://aaai.org/conference/aaai-25/\n\n### ICLR 2025\n**Date:** April 24-28, 2025\n**Location:** Singapore EXPO, Singapore\n**Focus:** Deep Learning & Representation Learning\n**Format:** Hybrid (in-person + virtual)\n**Registration:** https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/\n```\n\n### Product Launch (Text)\n```\n================================================================================\nQ1 2025 SMARTPHONE LAUNCHES\n================================================================================\n\nJANUARY 2025\n------------\n\nOnePlus 13 Series\nLaunch: January 7, 2025\nModels: OnePlus 13, OnePlus 13R\nProcessor: Snapdragon 8 Elite\nDisplay: 6.82\" LTPO AMOLED, 120Hz\nPrice: Starting $699 (expected)\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Series  \nLaunch: January 22-23, 2025\nModels: S25, S25+, S25 Ultra\nProcessor: Snapdragon 8 Elite / Exynos 2500\nDisplay: Up to 6.9\" Dynamic AMOLED\nSpecial Features: Galaxy AI 2.0, S Pen (Ultra)\n```\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n1. **Over-reliance on single sources** - Verify information across multiple sources\n2. **Outdated information** - Always check for the most recent announcements\n3. **Confusing regional dates** - Clarify timezones and regional variations\n4. **Missing context** - Include enough detail for readers to understand significance\n5. **Incomplete searches** - Don't stop at first search; iterate to find comprehensive information\n6. **Ignoring official sites** - Always attempt to fetch official websites when discovered\n7. **Inconsistent formatting** - Maintain structure throughout the document"
