This syntax can be used by the TypeScript compiler to type-check our code, and it can also be erased to emit clean, idiomatic JavaScript code. Type-checking is helpful because it can catch bugs in our code ahead of time, but adding types to our code also makes it more readable and allows tools like code editors to give us powerful features like auto-completion, refactorings, find-all-references, and more. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code, and in fact, if you write JavaScript in an editor like Visual Studio or VS Code, TypeScript is powering your JavaScript editor experience too! You can learn more about TypeScript on our website at [typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).\n\nTo get started using TypeScript through npm with the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install -D typescript\n```\n\nLet’s take a look at what’s new in TypeScript 5.7!\n\n## Checks for Never-Initialized Variables\n\nFor a long time, TypeScript has been able to catch issues when a variable has not yet been initialized in all prior branches.\n\n```\nlet result: number\nif (someCondition()) {\n    result = doSomeWork();\n}\nelse {\n    let temporaryWork = doSomeWork();\n    temporaryWork *= 2;\n    // forgot to assign to 'result'\n}\n\nconsole.log(result); // error: Variable 'result' is used before being assigned.\n```\n\nUnfortunately, there are some places where this analysis doesn’t work.\nFor example, if the variable is accessed in a separate function, the type system doesn’t know when the function will be called, and instead takes an \"optimistic\" view that the variable will be initialized.\n\n```\nfunction foo() {\n    let result: number\n    if (someCondition()) {\n        result = doSomeWork();\n    }\n    else {\n        let temporaryWork = doSomeWork();\n        temporaryWork *= 2;\n        // forgot to assign to 'result'\n    }\n\n    printResult();\n\n    function printResult() {\n        console.log(result); // no error here.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhile TypeScript 5.7 is still lenient on variables that have *possibly* been initialized, the type system is able to report errors when variables have *never* been initialized at all.\n\n```\nfunction foo() {\n    let result: number\n    \n    // do work, but forget to assign to 'result'\n\n    function printResult() {\n        console.log(result); // error: Variable 'result' is used before being assigned.\n    }\n}\n```\n\n[This change](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/55887) was contributed thanks to the work of GitHub user [Zzzen](https://github.com/Zzzen)!\n\n## Path Rewriting for Relative Paths\n\nThere are several tools and runtimes that allow you to run TypeScript code \"in-place\", meaning they do not require a build step which generates output JavaScript files.\nFor example, ts-node, tsx, Deno, and Bun all support running `.ts` files directly.\nMore recently, Node.js has been investigating such support with `--experimental-strip-types` (soon to be unflagged!) and `--experimental-transform-types`.\nThis is extremely convenient because it allows us to iterate faster without worrying about re-running a build task.\n\nThere is some complexity to be aware of when using these modes though.\nTo be maximally compatible with all these tools, a TypeScript file that’s imported \"in-place\" **must** be imported with the appropriate TypeScript extension at runtime.\nFor example, to import a file called `foo.ts`, we have to write the following in Node’s new experimental support:\n\n```\n// main.ts\n\nimport * as foo from \"./foo.ts\"; // <- we need foo.ts here, not foo.js\n```\n\nTypically, TypeScript would issue an error if we did this, because it expects us to import *the output file*.\nBecause some tools do allow `.ts` imports, TypeScript has supported this import style with an option called `--allowImportingTsExtensions` for a while now.\nThis works fine, but what happens if we need to actually generate `.js` files out of these `.ts` files?\nThis is a requirement for library authors who will need to be able to distribute just `.js` files, but up until now TypeScript has avoided rewriting any paths.\n\nTo support this scenario, we’ve added a new compiler option called `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`.\nWhen an import path is *relative* (starts with `./` or `../`), ends in a TypeScript extension (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`), and is a non-declaration file, the compiler will rewrite the path to the corresponding JavaScript extension (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`).\n\n```\n// Under --rewriteRelativeImportExtensions...\n\n// these will be rewritten.\nimport * as foo from \"./foo.ts\";\nimport * as bar from \"../someFolder/bar.mts\";\n\n// these will NOT be rewritten in any way.\nimport * as a from \"./foo\";\nimport * as b from \"some-package/file.ts\";\nimport * as c from \"@some-scope/some-package/file.ts\";\nimport * as d from \"#/file.ts\";\nimport * as e from \"./file.js\";\n```\n\nThis allows us to write TypeScript code that can be run in-place and then compiled into JavaScript when we’re ready.\n\nNow, we noted that TypeScript generally avoided rewriting paths.\nThere are several reasons for this, but the most obvious one is dynamic imports.\nIf a developer writes the following, it’s not trivial to handle the path that `import` receives.\nIn fact, it’s impossible to override the behavior of `import` within any dependencies.\n\n```\nfunction getPath() {\n    if (Math.random() < 0.5) {\n        return \"./foo.ts\";\n    }\n    else {\n        return \"./foo.js\";\n    }\n}\n\nlet myImport = await import(getPath());\n```\n\nAnother issue is that (as we saw above) only *relative* paths are rewritten, and they are written \"naively\".\nThis means that any path that relies on TypeScript’s `baseUrl` and `paths` will not get rewritten:\n\n```\n// tsconfig.json\n\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"module\": \"nodenext\",\n        // ...\n        \"paths\": {\n            \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```\n// Won't be transformed, won't work.\nimport * as utilities from \"@/utilities.ts\";\n```\n\nNor will any path that might resolve through the [`exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) and [`imports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#imports) fields of a `package.json`.\n\n```\n// package.json\n{\n    \"name\": \"my-package\",\n    \"imports\": {\n        \"#root/*\": \"./dist/*\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```\n// Won't be transformed, won't work.\nimport * as utilities from \"#root/utilities.ts\";\n```\n\nAs a result, if you’ve been using a workspace-style layout with multiple packages referencing each other, you might need to use [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports) with [scoped custom conditions](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#resolving-user-conditions) to make this work:\n\n```\n// my-package/package.json\n\n{\n    \"name\": \"my-package\",\n    \"exports\": {\n        \".\": {\n            \"@my-package/development\": \"./src/index.ts\",\n            \"import\": \"./lib/index.js\"\n        },\n        \"./*\": {\n            \"@my-package/development\": \"./src/*.ts\",\n            \"import\": \"./lib/*.js\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAny time you want to import the `.ts` files, you can run it with `node --conditions=@my-package/development`.\n\nNote the \"namespace\" or \"scope\" we used for the condition `@my-package/development`.\nThis is a bit of a makeshift solution to avoid conflicts from dependencies that might also use the `development` condition.\nIf everyone ships a `development` in their package, then resolution may try to resolve to a `.ts` file which will not necessarily work.\nThis idea is similar to\n\n<error>Content truncated.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\n**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited*)\n\n*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAlso, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n\nTo complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n2. When should the skill be used?\n3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.zip`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n",
