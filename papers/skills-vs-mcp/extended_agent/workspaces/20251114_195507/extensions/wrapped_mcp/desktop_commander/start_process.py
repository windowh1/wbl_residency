Auto-generated MCP tool wrapper for start_process
Server: desktop-commander
Description: Start a new terminal process with intelligent state detection.

                        PRIMARY TOOL FOR FILE ANALYSIS AND DATA PROCESSING
                        This is the ONLY correct tool for analyzing local files (CSV, JSON, logs, etc.).
                        The analysis tool CANNOT access local files and WILL FAIL - always use processes for file-based work.

                        CRITICAL RULE: For ANY local file work, ALWAYS use this tool + interact_with_process, NEVER use analysis/REPL tool.

                        Running on macOS. Default shell: zsh.

MACOS-SPECIFIC NOTES:
- Package manager: brew (Homebrew) is commonly used
- Python 3 might be 'python3' command, not 'python'
- Some GNU tools have different names (e.g., gsed instead of sed)
- System Integrity Protection (SIP) may block certain operations
- Use 'open' command to open files/applications from terminal
- For file search: Use mdfind (Spotlight) for fastest exact filename searches

                        REQUIRED WORKFLOW FOR LOCAL FILES:
                        1. start_process(\"python3 -i\") - Start Python REPL for data analysis
                        2. interact_with_process(pid, \"import pandas as pd, numpy as np\")
                        3. interact_with_process(pid, \"df = pd.read_csv('/absolute/path/file.csv')\")
                        4. interact_with_process(pid, \"print(df.describe())\")
                        5. Continue analysis with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

                        COMMON FILE ANALYSIS PATTERNS:
                        • start_process(\"python3 -i\") → Python REPL for data analysis (RECOMMENDED)
                        • start_process(\"node -i\") → Node.js for JSON processing  
                        • start_process(\"cut -d',' -f1 file.csv | sort | uniq -c\") → Quick CSV analysis
                        • start_process(\"wc -l /path/file.csv\") → Line counting
                        • start_process(\"head -10 /path/file.csv\") → File preview

                        BINARY FILE SUPPORT:
                        For PDF, Excel, Word, archives, databases, and other binary formats, use process tools with appropriate libraries or command-line utilities.

                        INTERACTIVE PROCESSES FOR DATA ANALYSIS:
                        1. start_process(\"python3 -i\") - Start Python REPL for data work
                        2. start_process(\"node -i\") - Start Node.js REPL for JSON/JS
                        3. start_process(\"bash\") - Start interactive bash shell
                        4. Use interact_with_process() to send commands
                        5. Use read_process_output() to get responses

                        SMART DETECTION:
                        - Detects REPL prompts (>>>, >, $, etc.)
                        - Identifies when process is waiting for input
                        - Recognizes process completion vs timeout
                        - Early exit prevents unnecessary waiting

                        STATES DETECTED:
                        Process waiting for input (shows prompt)
                        Process finished execution
                        Process running (use read_process_output)

                        PERFORMANCE DEBUGGING (verbose_timing parameter):
                        Set verbose_timing: true to get detailed timing information including:
                        - Exit reason (early_exit_quick_pattern, early_exit_periodic_check, process_exit, timeout)
                        - Total duration and time to first output
                        - Complete timeline of all output events with timestamps
                        - Which detection mechanism triggered early exit
                        Use this to identify missed optimization opportunities and improve detection patterns.

                        ALWAYS USE FOR: Local file analysis, CSV processing, data exploration, system commands
                        NEVER USE ANALYSIS TOOL FOR: Local file access (analysis tool is browser-only and WILL FAIL)

                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths for reliability. Paths are automatically normalized regardless of slash direction. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.
                        This command can be referenced as \"DC: ...\" or \"use Desktop Commander to ...\" in your instructions.
