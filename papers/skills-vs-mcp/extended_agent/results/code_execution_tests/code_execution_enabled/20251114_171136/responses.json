It was announced by the [Swedish Academy](/wiki/Swedish_Academy \"Swedish Academy\") in [Stockholm](/wiki/Stockholm \"Stockholm\"), [Sweden](/wiki/Sweden \"Sweden\"), on 10 October 2024 and was awarded on 10 December 2024.[[1]](#cite_note-1)\n\nShe is the [first South Korean](/wiki/List_of_Korean_Nobel_laureates_and_nominees \"List of Korean Nobel laureates and nominees\") and [first Asian woman](/wiki/List_of_Asian_Nobel_laureates \"List of Asian Nobel laureates\") to win the Nobel Prize in literature, making her the 18th [woman to win the Nobel Prize](/wiki/List_of_female_Nobel_laureates \"List of female Nobel laureates\") in that category.[[2]](#cite_note-2)\n\nHan Kang grew up with a literary background in [Seoul](/wiki/Seoul \"Seoul\"), her father, [Han Seung-won](/wiki/Han_Seung-won \"Han Seung-won\"), being a reputed novelist. Alongside her passion for writing, she spends time exploring arts and music, which is reflected throughout her literary production. She started her career in 1993 with the publication of her poems in the literary magazine *Literature and Society*, and had her debut prose publication in 1995 with the short story collection *Love of Yeosu* [여수의 사랑]. Her major breakthrough came with the 2007 novel *[The Vegetarian](/wiki/The_Vegetarian \"The Vegetarian\")* [채식주의자], a book that portrays the violent consequences that ensue when its protagonist suddenly begins to refuse to eat meat. Her experimental and often disturbing stories are characterized by a double exposure of pain and a correspondence between mental and physical torment, confronting historical traumas and invisible sets of rules and the fragility of human life. Her other well-known works include *[Human Acts](/wiki/Human_Acts \"Human Acts\")* [소년이 온다], *[The White Book](/wiki/The_White_Book \"The White Book\")* [흰], *[Greek Lessons](/wiki/Greek_Lessons \"Greek Lessons\")* [희랍어 시간] and *We Do Not Part* [작별하지 않는다].[[3]](#cite_note-3)[[4]](#cite_note-4)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Han_Kang_Vegetarian_2015_title.jpg/250px-Han_Kang_Vegetarian_2015_title.jpg)](/wiki/File:Han_Kang_Vegetarian_2015_title.jpg)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/HanKang.jpg/250px-HanKang.jpg)](/wiki/File:HanKang.jpg)\n\nAfter the announcement, [Anders Olsson](/wiki/Anders_Olsson_(writer) \"Anders Olsson (writer)\"), chairman of the Academy's Nobel Committee, said in a statement:\n\n> \"She has a unique awareness of the connections between body and soul, the living and the dead, and in her poetic and experimental style has become an innovator in contemporary prose.\"[[5]](#cite_note-reu-5)\n\n[Anna-Karin Palm](/wiki/Anna-Karin_Palm \"Anna-Karin Palm\") was interviewed by Carin Klaesson, a correspondent of the Nobel Prize Museum, and described Han Kang's writing with the following statement:\n\n> \"I would say this is a very rich and complex oeuvre that spans many genres, and [she] writes really intense lyrical prose that is both tender and brutal and, sometimes, slightly surrealistic as well... There's a continuity as to themes that is quite remarkable but at the same time a huge stylistic variation that makes every book a new aspect or a new expression of these central themes.\"[[6]](#cite_note-6)\n\nHan Kang had just finished dinner with her son at her home in [Seoul](/wiki/Seoul \"Seoul\") when she received the information. Both she and her son were so surprised that they did not even have the time to properly discuss it. She stated that she was \"honored\" to receive the prize. Being the first Nobel laureate in literature in South Korea, she said:\n\n> \"Yes. I grew up with books, you know, so since when I was a child, I grew up with books in Korean and translated as well. So I can say I grew up with Korean literature, which I feel very close to. So I hope this news is nice for Korean literature readers and my friends, writers... For me, since when I was a child, all writers have been collective. They are searching meanings in life. Sometimes they are lost and sometimes they are determined and all their efforts and all their strengths have been my inspiration. So it's very difficult for me to pick some names of the inspiration. It's very difficult for me.\"[[7]](#cite_note-nob-7)\n\nAsked by Nobel correspondent, Jenny Rydén, where someone just discovering her work should start, she suggested:\n\n> \"I think every writer likes his or her most recent book. So my most recent book is *We Do Not Part* or it is called *I Do Not Bid Farewell* or *Impossible Goodbyes*. I hope this book could be a start. And *Human Acts* is connected directly with this book *We Do Not Part*. And then *The White Book*, which is very personal book for me. Because it's quite autobiographical. And there is *The Vegetarian*. But I feel the start could be *We Do Not Part*.[[7]](#cite_note-nob-7)\n\nLater on, Han Kang said her celebrations would be low-key: \"After this phone call I'd like to have tea with - I don't drink so - I'm going to have tea with my son and I'll celebrate it quietly tonight.\"[[5]](#cite_note-reu-5)[[7]](#cite_note-nob-7)\n\n### International reactions\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2024_Nobel_Prize_in_Literature&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: International reactions\")]\n\nDiscussing the choice of Han Kang as the Nobel laureate on [Sveriges Television](/wiki/Sveriges_Television \"Sveriges Television\") minutes after the announcement, a panel of the Swedish literature critics Ingrid Elam, Jonas Thente and author Lyra Ekström Lindbäck disagreed on the Swedish Academy's choice. Elam said it was a very good choice, calling Han Kang \"a fantastic author\", while the others had not been impressed by her writing. \"Nobody is going to remember her in fifty years' time\", Thente said.[[8]](#cite_note-8)\n\nA negative reaction also appeared in *[Expressen](/wiki/Expressen \"Expressen\")* by literature critic Victor Malm who called it \"a rather weak choice\".[[9]](#cite_note-9) *[Svenska Dagbladet](/wiki/Svenska_Dagbladet \"Svenska Dagbladet\")'*s literature editor Josefin de Gregorio was pleased with the choice, praising Han Kang for her \"dynamic, transgressive writing that portrays deep evil and great trauma with lyrical beauty and vulnerability\" and the Academy's choice of a young and popular writer.[[10]](#cite_note-10) Irish novelist [Eimear McBride](/wiki/Eimear_McBride \"Eimear McBride\") was also pleased, calling Han Kang \"one of the greatest living writers\"; “She is a voice for women, for truth and, above all, for the power of what literature can be. This is a very richly deserved win.”[[11]](#cite_note-11)\n\nThe choice of Han Kang was well received by several German commentators, who found it a good choice and positive that the Swedish Academy after heavy focus on European literature in recent years had chosen a writer from another part of the world. \"One can call it strange for an award that aims to do comparative justice to all national literatures that so far so few Asian or African authors have been given consideration”, Andreas Platthaus in the [Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung](/wiki/Frankfurter_Allgemeine_Zeitung \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\") wrote.[[12]](#cite_note-12)\n\n#### South Korean reactions\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2024_Nobel_Prize_in_Literature&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: South Korean reactions\")]\n\nWhile visiting Laos for a meeting of Asian leaders, South Korean president [Yoon Suk Yeol](/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol \"Yoon Suk Yeol\") posted on his [Facebook account](/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\") his warmest greetings, saying:\n\n> \"It is a monumental achievement in the history of [Korean literature](/wiki/Korean_literature \"Korean literature\") and a national celebration that brings joy to all the people. You have transformed the painful wounds of our modern history into a great literary work. I extend my deepest respect to you for elevating the value of Korean literature.\"[[13]](#cite_note-13)[[14]](#cite_note-f24-14)\n\n[BTS member](/wiki/BTS \"BTS\") [V](/wiki/V_(singer) \"V (singer)\") shared in the news on [Instagram](/wiki/Instagram \"Instagram\"), writing: \"I read your book 'Human Act: A Novel' in the army. Congratulations\" alongside a bowing [emoji](/wiki/Emoji \"Emoji\").[[14]](#cite_note-f24-14) The literary critic Kim Seong-shin expressed that the Academy's choice of Han was beyond reproach, affirming: \"I'd say she is the most deserving Korean novelist to be awarded the Nobel Prize.\"[[14]](#cite_note-f24-14)\n\nA number of South Korean writers celebrated the news, among them [Min Jin Lee](/wiki/Min_Jin_Lee \"Min Jin Lee\"), author of *[Pachinko](/wiki/Pachinko_(novel) \"Pachinko (novel)\")*, who commented: \"Han Kang is a brilliant novelist who reflects our modern condition with courage, imagination, and intelligence.

She comes from a literary background, her father being a reputed novelist. Alongside her writing, she has also devoted herself to art and music, which is reflected throughout her entire literary production.\n\nHan Kang began her career in 1993 with the publication of a number of poems in the magazine **문학과사회**(“Literature and Society”). Her prose debut came in 1995 with the short story collection **여수의****사랑**(“Love of Yeosu”), followed soon afterwards by several other prose works, both novels and short stories. Notable among these is the novel **그대의****차가운****손** (2002; “Your Cold Hands”), which bears obvious traces of Han Kang’s interest in art. The book reproduces a manuscript left behind by a missing sculptor who is obsessed with making plaster casts of female bodies. There is a preoccupation with the human anatomy and the play between persona and experience, where a conflict arises in the work of the sculptor between what the body reveals and what it conceals. ‘Life is a sheet arching over an abyss, and we live above it like masked acrobats’ as a sentence towards the end of the book tellingly asserts.\n\nHan Kang’s major international breakthrough came with the novel **채식주의자**(2007; *The Vegetarian*, 2015). Written in three parts, the book portrays the violent consequences that ensue when its protagonist Yeong-hye refuses to submit to the norms of food intake. Her decision not to eat meat is met with various, entirely different reactions. Her behaviour is forcibly rejected by both her husband and her authoritarian father, and she is exploited erotically and aesthetically by her brother-in-law, a video artist who becomes obsessed with her passive body. Ultimately, she is committed to a psychiatric clinic, where her sister attempts to rescue her and bring her back to a ‘normal’ life. However, Yeong-hye sinks ever deeper into a psychosis-like condition expressed through the ‘flaming trees’, a symbol for a plant kingdom that is as enticing as it is dangerous.\n\nA more plot-based book is **바람이 분다, 가라** (“The Wind Blows, Go”) from 2010, a large and complex novel about friendship and artistry, in which grief and a longing for transformation are strongly present.\n\nHan Kang’s physical empathy for extreme life stories is reinforced by her increasingly charged metaphorical style. **희랍어****시간** (*Greek Lessons*, 2023) from 2011 is a captivating portrayal of an extraordinary relationship between two vulnerable individuals. A young woman who, following a string of traumatic experiences, has lost the power of speech connects with her teacher in Ancient Greek, who is himself losing his sight. From their respective flaws, a brittle love affair develops. The book is a beautiful meditation around loss, intimacy and the ultimate conditions of language.\n\nIn the novel **소년이****온다**(2014; *Human Acts*, 2016), Han Kang this time employs as her political foundation a historical event that took place in the city of Gwangju, where she herself grew up and where hundreds of students and unarmed civilians were murdered during a massacre carried out by the South Korean military in 1980. In seeking to give voice to the victims of history, the book confronts this episode with brutal actualization and, in so doing, approaches the genre of witness literature. Han Kang’s style, as visionary as it is succinct, nevertheless deviates from our expectations of that genre, and it is a particular expedient of hers to permit the souls of the dead to be separated from their bodies, thus allowing them to witness their own annihilation. In certain moments, at the sight of the unidentifiable corpses that cannot be buried, the text harks back to the basic motif of Sophocles’s *Antigone*.\n\nIn **흰**(2016; *The White Book*, 2017), Han Kang’s poetic style once again dominates. The book is an elegy dedicated to the person who could have been the narrative self’s elder sister, but who passed away only a couple of hours after birth. In a sequence of short notes, all concerning white objects, it is through this colour of grief that the work as a whole is associatively constructed. This renders it less a novel and more a kind of ‘secular prayer book’, as it has also been described. If, the narrator reasons, the imaginary sister had been allowed to live, she herself would not have been permitted to come into being. It is also in addressing the dead that the book reaches its final words: ‘Within that white, all of those white things, I will breathe in the final breath you released.’\n\nAnother highlight is the late work, **작별하지 않는다** (“We Do Not Part”) from 2021, which in terms of its imagery of pain is closely connected to *The White Book*. The story unfolds in the shadow of a massacre that took place in the late 1940s on South Korea’s Jeju Island, where tens of thousands of people, among them children and the elderly, were shot on suspicion of being collaborators. The book portrays the shared mourning process undertaken by the narrator and her friend Inseon, who both, long after the event, bear with them the trauma associated with the disaster that has befallen their relatives. With imagery that is as precise as it is condensed, Han Kang not only conveys the power of the past over the present, but also, equally powerfully, traces the friends’ unyielding attempts to bring to light what has fallen into collective oblivion and transform their trauma into a joint art project, which lends the book its title. As much about the deepest form of friendship as it is about inherited pain, the book moves with great originality between the nightmarish images of the dream and the inclination of witness literature to speak the truth.\n\nHan Kang’s work is characterized by this double exposure of pain, a correspondence between mental and physical torment with close connections to Eastern thinking. In **회복****하는****인간** = *Convalescence* from 2013, this involves a leg ulcer that refuses to heal and a painful relationship between the main character and her dead sister. No true convalescence ever actually takes place, and the pain emerges as a fundamental existential experience that cannot be reduced to any passing torment. In a novel such as *The Vegetarian*, no simple explanations are provided. Here, the deviant act occurs suddenly and explosively in the form of a blank refusal, with the protagonist remaining silent. The same can be said of the short story **에우로파** (2012; *Europa*, 2019), in which the male narrator, himself masked as a woman, is drawn to an enigmatic woman who has broken away from an impossible marriage. The narrative self remains silent when asked by his beloved: ‘If you were able to live as you desire, what would you do with your life?’ There is no room here for either fulfillment or atonement.\n\nIn her oeuvre, Han Kang confronts historical traumas and invisible sets of rules and, in each of her works, exposes the fragility of human life. She has a unique awareness of the connections between body and soul, the living and the dead, and in her poetic and experimental style has become an innovator in contemporary prose.\n\nAnders Olsson  \nChairman of the Nobel Committee\n\n## Bibliography – a selection\n\n### Works in Korean\n\n여수의 사랑. – 서울 : 문학과지성사, 1995  [“Love of Yeosu”.
