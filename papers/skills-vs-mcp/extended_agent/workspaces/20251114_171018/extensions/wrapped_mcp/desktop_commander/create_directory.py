"""
Auto-generated MCP tool wrapper for create_directory
Server: desktop-commander
Description: Create a new directory or ensure a directory exists.

Can create multiple nested directories in one operation.
Only works within allowed directories.

IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths for reliability. Paths are automatically normalized regardless of slash direction. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.
This command can be referenced as \"DC: ...\" or \"use Desktop Commander to ...\" in your instructions.
