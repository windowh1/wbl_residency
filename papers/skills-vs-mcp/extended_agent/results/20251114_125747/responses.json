This syntax can be used by the TypeScript compiler to type-check our code, and it can also be erased to emit clean, idiomatic JavaScript code. Type-checking is helpful because it can catch bugs in our code ahead of time, but adding types to our code also makes it more readable and allows tools like code editors to give us powerful features like auto-completion, refactorings, find-all-references, and more. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code, and in fact, if you write JavaScript in an editor like Visual Studio or VS Code, TypeScript is powering your JavaScript editor experience too! You can learn more about TypeScript on our website at [typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).\n\nTo get started using TypeScript through npm with the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install -D typescript\n```\n\nLet’s take a look at what’s new in TypeScript 5.7!\n\n## Checks for Never-Initialized Variables\n\nFor a long time, TypeScript has been able to catch issues when a variable has not yet been initialized in all prior branches.\n\n```\nlet result: number\nif (someCondition()) {\n    result = doSomeWork();\n}\nelse {\n    let temporaryWork = doSomeWork();\n    temporaryWork *= 2;\n    // forgot to assign to 'result'\n}\n\nconsole.log(result); // error: Variable 'result' is used before being assigned.\n```\n\nUnfortunately, there are some places where this analysis doesn’t work.\nFor example, if the variable is accessed in a separate function, the type system doesn’t know when the function will be called, and instead takes an \"optimistic\" view that the variable will be initialized.\n\n```\nfunction foo() {\n    let result: number\n    if (someCondition()) {\n        result = doSomeWork();\n    }\n    else {\n        let temporaryWork = doSomeWork();\n        temporaryWork *= 2;\n        // forgot to assign to 'result'\n    }\n\n    printResult();\n\n    function printResult() {\n        console.log(result); // no error here.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhile TypeScript 5.7 is still lenient on variables that have *possibly* been initialized, the type system is able to report errors when variables have *never* been initialized at all.\n\n```\nfunction foo() {\n    let result: number\n    \n    // do work, but forget to assign to 'result'\n\n    function printResult() {\n        console.log(result); // error: Variable 'result' is used before being assigned.\n    }\n}\n```\n\n[This change](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/55887) was contributed thanks to the work of GitHub user [Zzzen](https://github.com/Zzzen)!\n\n## Path Rewriting for Relative Paths\n\nThere are several tools and runtimes that allow you to run TypeScript code \"in-place\", meaning they do not require a build step which generates output JavaScript files.\nFor example, ts-node, tsx, Deno, and Bun all support running `.ts` files directly.\nMore recently, Node.js has been investigating such support with `--experimental-strip-types` (soon to be unflagged!) and `--experimental-transform-types`.\nThis is extremely convenient because it allows us to iterate faster without worrying about re-running a build task.\n\nThere is some complexity to be aware of when using these modes though.\nTo be maximally compatible with all these tools, a TypeScript file that’s imported \"in-place\" **must** be imported with the appropriate TypeScript extension at runtime.\nFor example, to import a file called `foo.ts`, we have to write the following in Node’s new experimental support:\n\n```\n// main.ts\n\nimport * as foo from \"./foo.ts\"; // <- we need foo.ts here, not foo.js\n```\n\nTypically, TypeScript would issue an error if we did this, because it expects us to import *the output file*.\nBecause some tools do allow `.ts` imports, TypeScript has supported this import style with an option called `--allowImportingTsExtensions` for a while now.\nThis works fine, but what happens if we need to actually generate `.js` files out of these `.ts` files?\nThis is a requirement for library authors who will need to be able to distribute just `.js` files, but up until now TypeScript has avoided rewriting any paths.\n\nTo support this scenario, we’ve added a new compiler option called `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`.\nWhen an import path is *relative* (starts with `./` or `../`), ends in a TypeScript extension (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts`), and is a non-declaration file, the compiler will rewrite the path to the corresponding JavaScript extension (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`).\n\n```\n// Under --rewriteRelativeImportExtensions...\n\n// these will be rewritten.\nimport * as foo from \"./foo.ts\";\nimport * as bar from \"../someFolder/bar.mts\";\n\n// these will NOT be rewritten in any way.\nimport * as a from \"./foo\";\nimport * as b from \"some-package/file.ts\";\nimport * as c from \"@some-scope/some-package/file.ts\";\nimport * as d from \"#/file.ts\";\nimport * as e from \"./file.js\";\n```\n\nThis allows us to write TypeScript code that can be run in-place and then compiled into JavaScript when we’re ready.\n\nNow, we noted that TypeScript generally avoided rewriting paths.\nThere are several reasons for this, but the most obvious one is dynamic imports.\nIf a developer writes the following, it’s not trivial to handle the path that `import` receives.\nIn fact, it’s impossible to override the behavior of `import` within any dependencies.\n\n```\nfunction getPath() {\n    if (Math.random() < 0.5) {\n        return \"./foo.ts\";\n    }\n    else {\n        return \"./foo.js\";\n    }\n}\n\nlet myImport = await import(getPath());\n```\n\nAnother issue is that (as we saw above) only *relative* paths are rewritten, and they are written \"naively\".\nThis means that any path that relies on TypeScript’s `baseUrl` and `paths` will not get rewritten:\n\n```\n// tsconfig.json\n\n{\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"module\": \"nodenext\",\n        // ...\n        \"paths\": {\n            \"@/*\": [\"./src/*\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```\n// Won't be transformed, won't work.\nimport * as utilities from \"@/utilities.ts\";\n```\n\nNor will any path that might resolve through the [`exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) and [`imports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#imports) fields of a `package.json`.\n\n```\n// package.json\n{\n    \"name\": \"my-package\",\n    \"imports\": {\n        \"#root/*\": \"./dist/*\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```\n// Won't be transformed, won't work.\nimport * as utilities from \"#root/utilities.ts\";\n```\n\nAs a result, if you’ve been using a workspace-style layout with multiple packages referencing each other, you might need to use [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports) with [scoped custom conditions](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#resolving-user-conditions) to make this work:\n\n```\n// my-package/package.json\n\n{\n    \"name\": \"my-package\",\n    \"exports\": {\n        \".\": {\n            \"@my-package/development\": \"./src/index.ts\",\n            \"import\": \"./lib/index.js\"\n        },\n        \"./*\": {\n            \"@my-package/development\": \"./src/*.ts\",\n            \"import\": \"./lib/*.js\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAny time you want to import the `.ts` files, you can run it with `node --conditions=@my-package/development`.\n\nNote the \"namespace\" or \"scope\" we used for the condition `@my-package/development`.\nThis is a bit of a makeshift solution to avoid conflicts from dependencies that might also use the `development` condition.\nIf everyone ships a `development` in their package, then resolution may try to resolve to a `.ts` file which will not necessarily work.\nThis idea is similar to\n\n<error>Content truncated.
